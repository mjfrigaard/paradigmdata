    "text": "How box works\nTo understand how box works, let’s refresh how we normally interact with packages and their functions when using R and developing packages:\n\nAssume I want to use the foo() function from the pkg package. The first step is to install it with install.packages(\"pkg\")\n\nTo use the functions in pkg:\n\nI need to run library(pkg) in my R session, which loads the pkg namespace ‘and attach[es] it on the search list.’\n\nIf I try to use a function (foo()) from a package (pkg) that hasn’t been loaded with library(pkg) or require(pkg), I see the following:\n\nfoo(x)\nError in foo(x) : could not find function 'foo'\n\n\nThis error can be confusing, because it’s not telling me if the package hasn’t been installed or if the package hasn’t been loaded.\n\nIf I try to use a function (foo()) from a package (pkg) that hasn’t been installed with install.packages(), I get the following error:\n\npkg::foo(x)\nError in loadNamespace(x) : there is no package called ‘pkg’\n\n\nAfter installing pkg, I can get around using library(pkg) by being explicit and using pkg::foo(), which tells R I want to use the foo() function from the pkg namespace\n\n\nRead more about namespaces in Advanced R and R packages.\n\n\n\nIf I am developing an R package, I can include pkg functions in my package by using roxygen2 tags (i.e., #' @importFrom pkg foo)\n\nWhen I use devtools::document(), the tags are converted into directives in the NAMESPACE (i.e., importFrom(pkg,foo))\nI also need to use usethis::use_package(\"pkg\") to include pkg in the DESCRIPTION under Imports:\n\n\n\nThe table below shows the connection between roxygen2 tags, the resulting NAMESPACE entry, and what should be listed in the DESCRIPTION (this is also covered in myPkgApp)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRefresher on roxygen2, NAMESPACE & DESCRPTION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nroxygen2 tag\n\n\nNAMESPACE directive\n\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\n\n\n\n\n@importFrom\n\n\nimportFrom() : import selected object from another NAMESPACE\n\n\nImports:\n\n\n\n\n@import\n\n\nimport(): import all objects from another package’s NAMESPACE.\n\n\nImports:\n\n\n\n\n@export\n\n\nexport() : export the function, method, generic, or class so it’s available outside of the package (in the NAMESPACE)\n\n\nNothing"
